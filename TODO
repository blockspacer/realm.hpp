    -> arena, realm, pillar, bulwark, arketyp, essence (escense), buckler, rymd, atex (ArcheType EntityX(cs), arkt.
    -> alt. .hpp as postfix cuz datz kewl xd.

* query & systems

* make archetypes immutable

auto q = query::of<const pos, vel>;

for (auto&& comps : q.fetch(&world)) {

}

world.query([](const pos, vel){


});


* fix cmake setup for testing & bench
* better test cases

* impl component fetch_types / event-system in queries ex,
    * emit<pos>     -> doesnt query pos but declares that it will create pos as an event
    * listen<pos>   -> declares the query will listen on emit of pos (allows to create a DAG graph of systems)
    * changed<pos>  -> query is called only if pos is changed
    these shold not be in the lambda (a additional template param maybe?)
    * not<pos>      -> exclude a component is a query
    * .....

* impl concepts
    * query functor has to be unique + either ref or ref const
    * components has to be something?
    * component array has to be unique

* when more c++20 features are default impl. modules, coroutines & ranges
